Simple little project aimed at telling me what Kerbal Space Program mods have been updated since the last time I checked, by parsing CKAN metadata.

I could try putting this functionality into the C# CKAN client itself, but using Ruby (a) lets me learn Ruby, which seems like an interesting language, and (b) might be interesting to put on the web at some point as a standalone webpage (probably with cookies for user config, such as last-check-date).

And yes, I'm aware that I'm using Ruby in a very procedural way, rather than OO.
